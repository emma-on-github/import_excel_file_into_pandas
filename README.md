Hello,

I am new to programming and are putting the theory into practice.

This simple Python code will import data from an Excel file on a website into a Pandas dataframe and then you can filter it by town/city.  As an autistic individual, I like to keep an eye on this website to see who (employers) have signed up to the Disability Confident Scheme in the UK.

If this code does not work in the future, itâ€™s because the URL has changed and I need to update it.  Please feel free to give me nudge if this is the case.  Thank you.

Paul
